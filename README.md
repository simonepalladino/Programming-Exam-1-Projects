# Exam Project - Programming Laboratory

## 1. Bingo Game Simulation

This project simulates the **classic Bingo game** with **5 players**, each randomly assigned a bingo card. Each card consists of **3 rows** with **5 numbers** each, ensuring that each row contains only one number per tens group (e.g., 1-10, 11-20, etc.), and no duplicates are allowed.

The algorithm randomly draws numbers from a pool (1-90) and ends when one player completes **Bingo**. The game also tracks milestones such as:
- **Ambo** (2 numbers)
- **Terno** (3 numbers)
- **Quaterna** (4 numbers)
- **Quintina** (5 numbers)
- **Tombola** (full card)

The program displays the players' cards at every milestone and announces the winner when a player achieves Bingo.

## 2. Antonyms Dictionary

This project simulates a **dictionary of Italian antonyms**, where words are indexed alphabetically and each word can have up to **5 antonyms**.

The user can:
- **Search** for a word and **view its antonyms** using **binary search** for efficient lookups.

The dictionary is implemented with a matrix-like structure, ensuring quick access and management of the word and antonym data. The program includes tests for each functionality to guarantee smooth operation and accurate results.

Both projects demonstrate core programming skills, including **randomization**, **data structure manipulation**, and **efficient searching**. Enjoy exploring these simulations!
